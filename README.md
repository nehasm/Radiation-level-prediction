# Radiation-level-prediction
Machine learning model to predict the level of radiation.


This dataset is available at kaggle.
The dataset contains such columns as: "wind direction", "wind speed", "humidity" and temperature.
The response parameter that is to be predicted is: "Solar_radiation".
It contains measurements for the 4 months to predict the level of solar radiation.
The solution started with loading the dataset and inspecting it.
Made changes in dataset to visualise data against time parameter.
After visualization,prepare data for prediction model.
Fit the data into prediction model to get the prediction.
Evaluate the data to get the accuracy.
